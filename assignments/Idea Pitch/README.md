# Smart Budgeting & Expense Tracker Web Application

## Problems
Dealing effectively with irregular income, using the most out of digital payment options and control of impulsive spending.

## Target users
Everyone, primarily students and other young adults who enter the world of personal finance.

## Solution
User-friendly tool that provides personal tips for enhancing financial literacy based on AI-powered spending insights, visualization of financial habits through interactive charts,
monthly savings goals, budget alerts and useful info about digital payment options when similar actions are consumed.

## How I came up with the idea
As I myself belong to the target audience, I find it very useful to have a tool like this app to get the most out of personal income, especially when inexperienced with buying stuff without clear reason and
long-term profitability. It's the common challenge for target users to resist the urge of impulsive spending whenever it happens.
